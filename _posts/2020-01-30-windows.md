*In Development...*

I very like my Fedora Linux environment for work, dev, scripts ect....

But unfortunately, is often complicate in entreprise due to standards, OS images, proxy etc...

For these reasons i have to find a way to do it on Windows 10.

I will post different solutions that i find to make easier as possible.

# Somes of my best friends on windows
- Visual Studio Code
- VirtualBox
- Git Bash
- Chocolatey alias choco
