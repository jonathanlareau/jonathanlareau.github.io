*In Development...*

### Why?
I've been looking for some time to share my ideas, pocs, explorations, results, etc ...

### What?
- Something free.
- I need an easy to use tool.
- A way to deploy to a fixed http address.
- Can be used anywhere.
- Keep history

### how we usually do?
On github.io, you can easily manage your static pages.  But managing the look and feel of multiple static pages can quickly become very complex.  For this reason, we will often use a database and an application to process and display the pages. 
Who says multiple servers says more expensive... 

### Github.io and Jekyll

Jekyll allows us to easily manage multiple pages with data saved in simple files. 
Githud.io allows both to keep the source files and to generate the pages in their chosen look and feel.
The use of github.io and jekyll in collaboration, perfectly meets the need for small websites and blogs.
